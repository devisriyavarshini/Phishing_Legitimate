# Phishing_Legitimate
Anti-phishing refers to efforts to block phishing attacks. Phishing is a kind of cybercrime where attackers pose as known or trusted entities and contact individuals through email, text or telephone and ask them to share sensitive information. Typically, in a phishing email attack, and the message will suggest that there is a problem with an invoice, that there has been suspicious activity on an account, or that the user must login to verify an account or password. Users may also be prompted to enter credit card information or bank account details as well as other sensitive data. Once this information is collected, attackers may use it to access accounts, steal data and identities, and download malware onto the userâ€™s computer.

# Process
The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 50 columns.

I have one target variable.
There are no null values present in the dataset.

Models used are logistic regression, Decision tree classifier, MLP classifier, XGB classifier, Support Vector Machine, Random forest.

I have applied these models for 50 features set, correlation reduced (25 features set), correlation reduced with 90% pve (17 components), 50 features set with 90% pve(30 components), with 85% pve(26 components), 80% pve(23 components), 75% pve (21 components) and with 70% pve(18 components).

I have plotted graph for accuracy v/s no. of components for support vector machine.

I have plotted the heat map for correlation matrix.
